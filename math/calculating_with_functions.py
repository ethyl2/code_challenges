This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

seven(times(five())) # must return 35
four(plus(nine())) # must return 13
eight(minus(three())) # must return 5
six(divided_by(two())) # must return 3

Looks like the number functions must allow either 0 or 1 parameters. The 1 parameter is an operation function invoked.
Looks like the operation functions must take a number function invoked as a parameter.
